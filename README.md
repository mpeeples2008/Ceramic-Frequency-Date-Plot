# Ceramic-Frequency-Date-Plot

This R script produces a exploratory visual for assessing site date ranges originally suggested to me by Wesley Bernardini (Redlands University). The plot consits of horizontal bars on an x-axis reprenting time with the width determined based on the production span for that type and with the height of each box determined based on the relative frequency of that type with types sorted vertically by start date. The script reads in csv files in the formatted of the example dataset here and produces a pdf containing results for each site.
